### This Application dev environment uses Django REST Framework as engine and Docker/docker-compose for deployment
### and all code is then uploaded to github for storage.  This method removed the need to create a virtual environment 
### on the dev server and allows everything to be programtically create at runtime thus leaving the server spotless. 
### The -rm command automatically removed the containers at stop to prevent build up so it is a completely dynamic 
### Dev/Host environment which is then easily deployed to Hosting Service.
